\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
To conclude, we have designed and implemented Rust libraries for developing IEEE 2030.5 clients with an emphasis on safety, correctness, reliability, and interface ergonomics. Furthermore, our work paves the way for IEEE 2030.5 servers to be implemented in Rust. In this thesis we have discussed the high-level design decisions, and the technical considerations that have guided our implementation. We have also evaluated our progress, and explored future improvements.

With the core functionality implemented, our libraries have been released under open-source licenses, and those interested in building IEEE 2030.5 clients can begin learning and experimenting with the API we provide.
In the future, we will work with users and potential contributors to address issues, and implement additional functionality, such that we can produce a fully compliant, high quality IEEE 2030.5 client implementation.
