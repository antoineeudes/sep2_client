\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Jawad Ahmed and Nadeem Ahmed for their guidance as supervisor and assessor, respectively.

I would also like to thank Neel Bhaskar for his work on an IEEE 2030.5 server implementation as part of research at UNSW previously.

I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of all contributors to open-source software, especially in the Rust ecosystem. This thesis simply wouldn't have been possible without them.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support throughout my degree, and this thesis.
