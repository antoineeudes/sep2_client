\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
IEEE 2030.5 is a standardised application-layer communications protocol between end-user energy devices, and electric utility management systems. In recent years, the protocol has seen unanimous adoption, and proposed adoption by DNSP's in Australia, and the United States of America.
This thesis will discuss how we have leveraged modern programming techniques, and the Rust programming language, to produce a safe, secure, robust, reliable, and open-source implementation of a IEEE 2030.5 client library that can be used to develop software for use in the smart grid ecosystem.
