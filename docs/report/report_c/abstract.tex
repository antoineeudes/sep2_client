\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
IEEE 2030.5 is a standardised application-layer communications protocol between end-user energy devices, and electric utility management systems.
This thesis will analyze how modern programming techniques have been used to produce a safe, secure, robust, reliable, and open-source implementation of an IEEE 2030.5 client library for use in end-user energy devices.
